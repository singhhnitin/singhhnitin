Backend Overview (Short and Crisp)
HTML Structure and Styling:

Lays out the basic structure with sections for map, weather updates, info box, survivor selection popup, and chat.

Inline CSS ensures the page is visually appealing with proper positioning, dimensions, and visual effects.

Leaflet.jsfor Mapping:

Initializes and displays the map centered on Bhubaneswar using OpenStreetMap tiles.

Adds markers for zombies, users, and resources using custom icons for visual distinction.

Custom Icons and Markers:

Zombie markers are red circles indicating zombie presence.

User markers are green circles showing the user's position.

Resource markers use icons from external URLs to depict food, medical supplies, and weapons.

Survivor Data and Interactive Elements:

Stores survivor data in an array, each with a name and coordinates for placing markers.

Includes HTML elements for survivor selection and chatting, styled for accessibility and interactivity.

Weather and Information Updates:

A card displays real-time weather updates from an API.

An info box shows details like the nearest zombie, survivor, resource, and total zombie count for informed decision-making.

Event Listeners and User Interaction:

Handles interactions with survivor selection and chat functionalities using event listeners.

Enables communication through a chat interface when a survivor is selected.

Simulated Data and Regular Updates:

Maintains and periodically updates simulated zombie positions to reflect real-time movements.

Functions regularly refresh data to keep the map and information current.

User Position and Marker:

Adds a marker for the user's current position, updating dynamically as they move to keep the map centered.

Distance Calculations:

Calculates distances from the user's position to the nearest zombie, survivor, and resource.

Updates the info box with these distances whenever the user's position changes.

Zombie Marker Management:

Uses a layer group to manage all zombie markers efficiently, updating them without refreshing the entire map.

Simulates zombie movement with slight random adjustments and updates their positions.

Zombie Cluster Detection:

Detects clusters of three or more zombies within a proximity to identify danger zones.

Initial Rendering of Resources and Survivors:

Adds markers for resources and survivors at predefined locations, each with a popup indicating their type or name.

Regular Updates:

Updates zombie positions every second to reflect their movement and keep the map dynamic.

Ensures the map is populated with the latest data when it first loads.

Chat Functionality:

Provides a popup for selecting a survivor to chat with and a chat box for sending and receiving messages.

Handles user interactions with the chat interface and simulates AI responses.

AI Response Generation:

Generates predefined responses based on user input to simulate real-time conversation.

Efficiency and Real-Time Updates:
Efficient Marker Management: Uses layer groups to update markers without refreshing the map.

Real-Time Distance Calculations: Ensures the user is always informed of the nearest zombies, survivors, and resources.

Cluster Detection: Identifies danger zones by detecting zombie clusters.

Interactive Chat: Enhances user experience with real-time chat and AI responses.
